QStreaming is built on top of [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) and is mainly made of following components:

#### Pipeline DSL

A configuration file defines the queries of the ETL Pipeline, it's  made of by the input tables, metric statements, data quality check rules (optional ) and output tables

#### Pipeline DSL Parser

A parser  parsing the **Pipeline DSL**  using  [Antlr](https://www.antlr.org/) parser generator and build the pipeline domain models

#### Pipeline translater

A  translater translate the pipeline  generated by **Pipeline DSL parser** into spark transformations

#### Data Quality Checker

Data quality checker is use to verify/measure  intermediate or final dataset according to the data quality check rules which defined in **Pipeline DSL** file

#### Pipeline Runner

Pipeline Runner scheduling and run the pipeline as a spark batch/streaming application
